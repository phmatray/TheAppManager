# Contributing to TheAppManager

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TheAppManager! This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version specified in `global.json`)
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C# extension

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TheAppManager.git
   cd TheAppManager
   ```
2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
3. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
4. Run the tests to make sure everything works:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Project Structure

```
src/TheAppManager/              - Class library (published as NuGet package)
samples/TheAppManager.Sample/   - Sample ASP.NET Core app demonstrating usage
tests/TheAppManager.Tests/      - Unit and integration tests
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes in small, focused commits.
3. Write or update tests to cover your changes.
4. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Code Style

This project uses an `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent formatting. Please ensure your editor respects it, or run:

```bash
dotnet format
```

General guidelines:

- Enable nullable reference types (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` is set project-wide).
- Use `latest` C# language features where appropriate.
- Follow standard .NET naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for locals).

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation (README, XML doc comments) if your changes affect public APIs.
2. Ensure the solution builds without warnings:
   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```
3. Ensure all tests pass.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
5. Describe what your PR does and why.
6. Address any review feedback.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/phmatray/TheAppManager/issues).
- Search existing issues before creating a new one.
- Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, and the expected vs. actual behavior.
